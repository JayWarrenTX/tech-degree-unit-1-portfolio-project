        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>After spending 15 years as an international touring/recording drummer based in New York, Los Angeles, and Nashville, Jay Warren made the decision to relocate to his hometown of Georgetown, TX - a place well known for the accolades of its public school music program, and association with Austin's rich musical heritage.</p>

          <p>A product of the Georgetown ISD music program; Jay studied under the direction of legendary Texas Music Educator Rodney Klett, <a href="https://halbowman.com/teachers">Hal Bowman</a>, <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jC8yJERN9rg">Gary Faust</a>, and Bryan Wright. He started touring professionally at 17, and was accepted to The Collective School of Music in New York City, studying Contemporary Music Performance with a Secondary Concentration in Afro-Cuban/Brazilian Drums and Percussion under the instruction of world renowned educators Kim Plainfield, Peter Retzlaff, Michael Lauren, "Memo" Acevedo, Adriano Santos, Horacio Hernandez, Luis Conte, and David Garibaldi.
          After graduating in December of 2001, he got his first job as a session drummer for Sundance Fellowship Composer Omar Fadel in Los Angeles, CA. Jay continued for the next 9 years to work as a professional drummer in L.A., touring all over the world with a variety of high-production value Major Label and independent artists, as well as making records with several Grammy nominated/winning, multi-platinum producers and engineers including Brian Virtue (Deftones, Jane's Addiction), Krish Sharma (Satellite Party), Scott Eric Olivier (No Doubt, Daniel Lanois), and Adam O'Dor (Bart Crow, Dixie Chicks), in addition to Texas favorites like Danny Reisch (The Black Angels, Shearwater), Erik Wofford (Cacophony Recorders), Chris Burns, Nick Joswick, Ryan Joseph, and Eric Herbst (Panhandle House Studios).</p>

          <p>More recently, Jay has toured/recorded with Texas music icon <a href="http://www.garypnunn.com">Gary P. Nunn</a>, multi-instrumentalist phenomenon/Grammy nominated <a href="https://www.slimbawb.com/">"Slim Bawb" Pearce</a>, and Universal/Motown/Vagrant Records recording artist <a href="https://www.blackjoelewis.com/">Black Joe Lewis</a>.
